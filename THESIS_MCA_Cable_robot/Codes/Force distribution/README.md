# 🧵 Cable Force Distribution (IPAnema 3) — Feasibility Check + Plots

This folder contains scripts to compute and visualize the **force distribution on each of the 8 cables** for every pose (row) in a motion-cue CSV generated by the Motion Cueing Algorithm pipeline.

---

## ✅ Requirements
- **Python 3.9.19**
- **WiPy3** (required by the force distribution / robot interface)

> Note: These scripts were developed and tested specifically with WiPy3 + Python 3.9.19.

---

## 🎯 What `force_dis_MCA.py` does
Given a CSV file containing motion cues / poses (row-wise), the script:

- Computes the force distribution on **all 8 cables** for each pose.
- Calls `IRobot.getForceDistribution()` to validate if the pose is feasible.

### Feasibility logic
- If `IRobot.getForceDistribution()` returns **False**, it means the pose is **not feasible** for the cable robot (at least one cable force is outside the configured limits).
- For infeasible poses:
  - A row of **zeros** is written for that pose in the output force-distribution data.
  - The indices / pose numbers that are infeasible are printed to the terminal when the script runs.

### Plotting
- The computed cable forces are plotted (one curve per cable) to visualize force evolution over the trajectory.

## ▶️ How to run (example)
From this folder:

```bash
python force_dis_MCA.py
```
If your script expects an input CSV path inside the code, set it to the motion-cue output you want to check (example: processed_motion_data*.csv or your generated pose CSV).

## 📁 Typical outputs

Depending on the script version, outputs usually include:

- A CSV containing force values for each cable per pose (8 columns)
- A plot showing cable forces across time / pose index
- Printed list of infeasible poses (where force distribution returned False)

## 📝 Notes

If you see many infeasible poses, it usually indicates:
- motion cue parameters are too aggressive, or
- platform pose goes outside workspace / cable tension constraints, or
- force limits are set too strictly for the current trajectory/payload.
