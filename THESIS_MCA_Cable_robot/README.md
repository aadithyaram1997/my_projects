# Application of Motion-Cueing Algorithm on a Cable-Driven Parallel Robot (CDPR)

This repository contains the complete project files (code, report, and presentation) for the Master thesis **“Application of Motion-Cueing Algorithm on a Cable-Driven parallel robot”**.

The work focuses on implementing and evaluating a **Classical Washout Algorithm (CWA)** for motion cueing on a **Cable-Driven Parallel Robot (CDPR)**, with feasibility enforced using **cable force distribution constraints** (target platform: IPAnema 3 at Fraunhofer IPA, 8-cable CDPR).

## Project overview (what this thesis does)

###  1) Dataset generation (FlightGear)
A flight trajectory dataset is created using FlightGear by logging:
- 📈 Translational accelerations (x, y, z)
- 🧭 Rotations / attitude (roll, pitch, yaw)

These signals are exported to CSV and used as the input to the motion cueing algorithm.

###  2) Classical Washout Algorithm (CWA) implementation
The Classical Washout Algorithm is implemented in Python following the typical 3-channel structure:
-  Translational channel (high-frequency cues via high-pass filtering + integration)
-  Rotational channel (high-frequency rotational cues via high-pass filtering + integration)
-  Tilt-coordination channel (low-frequency translational cues approximated using gravity-induced tilt)

Key parameters (scaling factors, washout damping, filter order, cut-off frequencies, sampling rate) can be tuned to control:
-  How aggressively motion is reproduced
-  How fast the platform “washes out” back to neutral
-  How the signal is separated into low/high frequency components

The algorithm output is a 6-DOF pose trajectory (motion cues), saved as CSV and visualized with plots.

###  3) Force feasibility using cable force distribution
Because CDPRs are constrained by cable tension limits, every generated pose is checked for feasibility using cable force distribution.
If a pose is not feasible (forces outside limits), it is flagged as invalid in the force distribution results.

###  4) Cost-function based optimisation (optional)
A force-based cost function is defined to compare:
- forces implied by the input trajectory  
vs.  
- forces implied by the motion-cued output trajectory

Optimisation is performed to tune selected washout parameters (primarily translational washout damping), while enforcing feasibility via cable force checks.

##  Running the project (typical workflow)

1. Go to `Codes/Flight gear parameters/` ✈️  
   Generate / log FlightGear motion data to CSV.

2. Go to `Codes/MCA Classical Washout/` 🌀  
   Run the CWA implementation to generate motion cues (output CSV + plots).

3. Go to `Codes/Force distribution/` 🧵  
   Compute cable forces for the generated motion cues and validate feasibility.

4. (Optional) Use `Codes/Cost_factor/` and `Codes/FD_cost_factor/` 🧮  
   Evaluate force-factor metrics and run optimisation variants.

## Environment notes

- Some scripts require **WiPy3** and are intended to run on **Python 3.9.19**.
- Several scripts contain hardcoded paths and filenames from the original thesis setup.  
  If something fails, first check and update the input/output file paths inside the script.

##  Key results (high level)

-  A complete simulation pipeline was developed to generate **force-feasible** motion cues for a CDPR using a Classical Washout Algorithm.
-  The cost-function optimisation produced modest improvements in the cost metric in some cases, and improved overall force stability in cable force distribution plots.
-  The approach was additionally tested on different trajectories and payload conditions.

##  Future work (from thesis outlook)

-  Hardware implementation on a real motion platform
-  Optimisation of rotational parameters (not only translational damping)
-  Axis-wise / decoupled optimisation strategies
-  Adaptive platform orientation / origin shifting for better workspace usage
- ⏱ Real-time optimisation and generalisation to other CDPR systems
